 				<div class="panel-body">
 					<p>ACURET, has conducted two editions a 5-days Intensive workshop with practical hands-on on Essentials of Responsible Animal Based Experimentation [RANEXT basics] in conjunction with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba providing knowledge and skills to young scientists, researchers, Faculty, Medical and Veterinary professionals, graduate students and lab animal technologist from across the country. This project is raising the bar on the number of Africans skilled in humane animal care and use for scientific purposes, who are expected to return to their Institutions and put into practice the knowledge and skills acquired from the training. In this regard, they are required to voluntarily submit their animal experimentation protocol proposal to a properly constituted and effectively functional IACUC for review and approve BEFORE they begin their work. The absence of this structure in your Institution could become a hindrance to their application of best clinical practices. The Number of such trained and skilled researchers are rising across Nigerian Universities, which MUST be complemented by functional IACUC/AEC</p>

				  <p>Does your University have a properly constituted Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or Animal Ethics Committee? Please do not take this to mean the same as the Ethical Committee with oversight for human participation in research, such as HREC.  The mandates are completely different and the modus operandi diverse. For instance, while humans participating in research have the opportunity to make an ‘informed consent’ for their participation, animals on the other hand, do not; hence the approach to the ethical consideration for animals used in research must be different.</p>

	 					<p>Reproducibility and clinical translatability are central to the scientific value of animal studies in biomedical research. Reproducibility refers to the ability to replicate the outcomes of an animal study by the same or different investigators. Clinical translatability recognizes the intent of biomedical research to advance human health and refers to the ability to “translate” outcomes or insights from animal studies to human patients. Since scientific value is a central underpinning of animal research ethics, these topics are squarely in the line of sight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p>

					  	<p>However, many Nigerian Institutions today use animals in experiments for biomedical research without the benefits of an oversight IACUC. This is a major reason why several PIs find it difficult to publish their manuscripts reporting these studies, as most Editors of Biomedical journals now demand evidence for the ethical approval of the study by a properly constituted IACUC. </p>
					  	<p>ACURET would be ecstatic to work with you and those with interest in this matter to achieve voluntary self-regulated humane animal care and use for scientific purposes at your Institution. ACURET intends working with Nigerian Institutions to resolve this dilemma by training selected delegates (from amongst the committee members) in line with the provisions of the mandate of the oie, the Guide and International Principles for the use of animals in Biomedical research. These will return to train their entire committee to establish a well-functioning IACUC that will strive to nurture an institutional culture that places value in enhancing the scientific quality of research to help assure the reproducibility of animal studies and translational success of animal models. This is integral to both high quality science as well as excellence in the supporting animal care and use.</p>

 					<p>The Event, IACUC in Nigeria – is a two (2) - full days intensive highly integrated Workshop, with interactive networking between participants and the Instructional experts from within and outside Africa. It is planned to hold from 24th – 26th July, 2019 at the Calabar International Convention Center, a serene state-of-the-art conference facility that affords participants every opportunity to maximize the benefits of the gathering.</p> 
 					<p>ACURET intends to train a delegation of three (3) from your Institution during this event. Preferably current members of your Institutional Animal Ethics Committee OR, where you are yet to have such a committee in place, individuals appointable to this committee upon their return from the training.</p>

				  <p>Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) have a mandated role under the World Organization for Animal Health charter, (Nigeria is a signatory) to assure the ethical and humane use of research animals in experiments conducted in Nigerian Institutions. The IACUC by virtue of its mandated functions is well positioned to help nurture and foster an institutional culture of optimized animal use working with the concepts of the 3Rs (refinement, reduction, replacement), while encouraging high quality reproducible studies that contribute to translational success. </p>
